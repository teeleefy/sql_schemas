-- **Part Three: Soccer League**
-- Design a schema for a simple sports league. Your schema should keep track of
-- - All of the teams in the league
-- - All of the goals scored by every player for each game
-- - All of the players in the league and their corresponding teams
-- - All of the referees who have been part of each game
-- - All of the matches played between teams
-- - All of the start and end dates for season that a league has
-- - The standings/rankings of each team in the league (This doesnâ€™t have to be its own table if the data can be captured somehow).



-- from the terminal run:
-- psql < soccer.sql
